# # What Is ITSM? Is It Still Relevant in the Digital Age?

## What’s ITSM?

_Short for IT service management, ITSM includes all the activities, policies, and processes that organizations use for deploying, managing, and improving IT service delivery. – **Joe Hertvik**

ITSM has existed for decades—since we began using technology to [[Service Delivery]]. But, today, we are seeing a transitional approach that tries to do two things at once:

1.  Extract the good from the past, such as [service desk](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/service-desk-best-practices/) and [incident management](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/incident-management/).
2.  Embrace new digital realities, which are characterized by a technology first delivery that is customer centric at heart and agile in operation.

[According to Kirstie Magowan](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/state-of-itsm/), organizations and people need to stop considering IT service management as its own silo that delivers technology solutions. Instead, we need to think about service management holistically, as a key vehicle for delivering business value—not just IT value.
