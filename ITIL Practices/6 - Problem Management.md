- **The purpose of the problem management practice** is to *reduce the likelihood and impact  of incidents* by identifying actual and potential causes of incidents and managing **workarounds**  and **known errors**.

- **Reduce the likelihood** and **impact of incidents**: *Giảm thiểu khả năng và tác động mạnh của sự cố.*
- Identifying actual and potential causes of incidents: *Xác định/ nhận diện nguyên nhân hoặc nguyên nhân tiềm ẩn*
- Managing workarounds and known errors: *Quản lý những giải pháp tạm thời và những lỗi đã nhận biết.*
	- [[A problem]] is a cause, or potential cause, of **one or more incidents**
	- [[A known error]] is a problem that has **been analyzed** and has **not been resolved**
	- **A [[Workaround]]** is a *solution* that *reduces or eliminates the impact* of an incident or problem for which a **full resolution is not yet available**.

![[Workaround]]

- Problem **Identification** => Problem **Control** => Error **Control**

- **Phases 1 - Problem Identification**:
		- Performing **trend analysis** of incident records;
		- Detecting **duplicate** and **recurring issues**;
		- During major incident management, **identifying a risk** that an incident could recur;
		- **Analyzing information received** from suppliers and partners;
		- Analyzing information received from internal software developers, test teams, and project teams.

- **Phases 2 - Problem Control**:
		- Problem analysis, and **documenting workarounds** and known errors.
		- Problems will **be prioritized based on the risk** they pose in terms of probability and impact to services => Được ưu tiên dựa trên sự nguy hiểm
		- When a problem cannot be resolved quickly, it is often useful to find and **document a workaround for future incidents**, based on an understanding of the problem.

- **Phases 3 - Error Control**:
		- Manage known errors, and may enable the identification of potential permanent solutions.
		- Where a permanent solution requires change control, this has to be analyzed from the perspective of cost, risk and benefits.
		- Regularly re-assesses the status of known errors that have not been resolved
