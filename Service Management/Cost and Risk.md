### Cost 
- Costs refer to the amount of **money spent** on a specific activity or resource. 
- **Costs imposed** on the consumer by the service **(the costs of service consumption)**. 
- **Costs removed** from the consumer by the service **(a part of the value proposition)** 

### Risk 
 - Risks refer to **possible events** that could **cause harm or loss**, or make it **more difficult** to achieve objectives.
- **Risks imposed** on a consumer by the service **(risks of service consumption)**
- **Risks removed** from a consumer by the service **(part of the value proposition)**


#### The consumer contributes to the reduction of risk through:
- Actively participating in the definition of the requirements of the service and  the clarification of its required outcomes.
- **Clearly communicating** the critical success factors and **constraints** that apply to the service.
- Ensuring the provider has access to the necessary resources of the consumer throughout the service relationship.
- Service provider should be able to get customer’s location data in order to know where to dispatch a car.
